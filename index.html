  <h3 class="display-3">Library Technician</h3>
  <p class="lead">2015-2017</p>
  <p class="lead">I work in Project Enable which is intended to ensure that no student is left behind as they pursue their post-secondary education and as they study and research in ACC libraries and also help disable students do their work
   I participate in it by using the devices -- petting them - and then evaluating them. The results of student’s responses will help Library Services decide which assistive devices, technology and hardware could be considered for college-wide use.
   Project Enable is consistent with the college's focus on accessibility and universal design and learning and the ACC's Student Success Initiative.  These assistive devices and software can be used to meet the learning needs of all students who rely on adaptive technology to be independent researchers. Project Enable also helps to educate our community about assistive technology and universal design and learning.
